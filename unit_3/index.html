<h1>A bit about me.</h1>
<br>

<p>I have creatively assisted clients in both the non-profit and commercial areas. 
My experience goes from book design and publishing, direct response marketing, TV and radio
to digital marketing.</p>

<br>
Expertese with inDesign, Illustrator, Photoshop, Flash, Interactive Media.
Juggling several hats within a project is an everyday occurrence for me.

<br>

<h1>I am a strategic thinker.</h1>

<br>

<p>I have a very strong background in direct response marketing. 
Most recently, I have enjoyed developing and executing creative concepts 
in the medical area. This has included Tv, radio, print, outdoor, web, 
direct response mail, interactive and internal communications.</p>

<br>

<p>I have, at a moments notice, the best illustrator, photographers, film crew, writer, 
media planner, production and printing available. What most agencies create in weeks 
I create in days.</p>
