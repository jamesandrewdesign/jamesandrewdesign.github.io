I have creatively assisted clients in both the non-profit and commercial areas. My experience in direct response marketing, digital marketing, â€‹TV, radio, print, outdoor and transit. 

For the past few years, my concentration has been in the medical area.

My abilities are well versed with inDesign, Illustrator, Photoshop, Web and Interactive. 

Juggling several hats within a project is an everyday occurrence for me.

I am a strategic thinker with a very strong background in direct response marketing.
